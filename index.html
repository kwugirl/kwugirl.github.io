      </a>

      <p>Call me KWu (pronounced "K. Wu"). I'm from the great state of New Jersey and used to work at Google NYC as the DART Sales Manager Product Specialist. In 2013, I graduated from <a href="http://hackbrightacademy.com/">Hackbright Academy</a> and have worked as a Ruby developer at <a href="http://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a> in Portland, OR since then.</p>

      </a>

      <p>I started giving talks at tech conferences in 2014. I mostly got into it because people said it would be good for my career as a developer and I don't especially dislike public speaking, even if I don't think I'm particularly gifted at it either. I'm always interested in getting better, though, and occasionally <a href="http://kwugirl.blogspot.com/search/label/talks">blog about public speaking resources and tips</a>. I use <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/kwugirl">Speaker Deck for sharing my slides</a>.</p>

      <p>My favorite part is probably getting certain ideas I want to spread into the talk format, for more efficient sharing :D but traveling to interesting places and easier meeting of people after I've given a talk are also up there! If you would be interested in me giving a talk at your conference, please do <a href="#contact">reach out</a> and let me know the details.</p>

      Talks that I've delivered:

          Mentoring
        </h2>
      </a>

      <p>I quite enjoy helping people figure out how they can better position themselves to get what they want! As I am very much an <a href="http://kwugirl.blogspot.com/2015/05/ask-vs-guess-culture-communications.html">Ask Culture person</a>, you are welcome* to ask me questions.</p>

      <p>I am especially interested in talking to folks who hadn't previously considered careers in the tech world, but I also served as a public speaking mentor in the <a href="https://tinyletter.com/techspeak">Technically Speaking</a> newsletter's first anniversary celebration. Additionally, I'm fascinated by how to improve relationships in the workplace and pulling together practical wording suitable for different situations and personalities. Overall, I somewhat feel like I can help troubleshoot bugs in people's careers/lives and set up systems for continuous, iterative improvement, whether that's a learning plan or getting promoted :)</p>

      <p>To increase my responsiveness and ability to help you, please try to be clear and specific in describing your request(s) and goal(s). I recommend reading over <a href="https://lizmrush.com/help-me-help-you/">Liz Rush's excellent advice</a> on how to help her (well, now me, I suppose!) help you, <a href="http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2015/11/23/advice-mentors-and-questionably-helpful-emails/">Cate Huston's blog post about advice &amp; mentoring emails</a>, and this <a href="http://www.askamanager.org/2016/02/cold-emailing-strangers-to-ask-for-career-advice.html">Ask a Manager post on cold-emailing strangers to ask for career advice</a>.</p>

      <p>All my advice should be received with an appropriately-sized grain of salt, of which you are the best judge. I'm not offended at all by people choosing to go in other directions, too; the only litmus test that matters is whether some idea is useful to <em>you</em> or not. If I say something that ends up being bad advice though, I would very much appreciate being informed so that I can reflect on it and avoid accidentally inflicting it on some other future victim.</p>

      <p>I have to confess that I don't like writing very much, so for particularly involved topics, a videochat or phone call might be best. If we're in the same location, I don't drink coffee but I'm still happy to meet up for hot chocolate or chai.</p>
