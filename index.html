      </a>

      <p>Call me KWu (pronounced "K. Wu"). I'm from the great state of New Jersey and used to work at Google NYC as the DART Sales Manager Product Specialist. In 2013, I graduated from <a href="http://hackbrightacademy.com/">Hackbright Academy</a> and have worked as a Ruby developer at <a href="http://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a> in Portland, OR since then.</p>

      <p>I started giving talks at tech conferences in 2014. I mostly got started because people said it would be good for my career as a developer and I don't especially dislike public speaking, even if I don't think I'm particularly gifted at it either. I'm always interested in getting better, though, and occasionally <a href="http://kwugirl.blogspot.com/search/label/talks">blog about public speaking resources and tips</a>. I use <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/kwugirl">Speaker Deck for sharing my slides</a>.</p>

      <p>My favorite part is probably getting certain ideas I want to spread into the talk format, for more efficient sharing :D but traveling to interesting places and easier meeting of people after I've given a talk are also up there! If you would be interested in me giving a talk at your conference, please do <a href="#contact">reach out</a> and let me know the details.</p>
